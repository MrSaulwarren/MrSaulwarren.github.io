        <p>I'm on a mission to become a professional web developer, not because it is easy but because it is hard. nothing worth doing in life is easy especially if it's something you actually want to pursue. Have you ever watched the pusuit of happiness?
          quite an inspiration of a movie.</p>

        <p>I shared the main characters struggles and pain on his journey <em>Will Smith</em> that he had finally found something worth pursuing. He had decided to succeed for his own reasons and for himself. I found myself wanting to find a profession or
          a work purpose and decided to make a success of it for my own reasons too.</p>

        <p>Steven spelberg said "I decided to become a movie director or die trying" what do you know, I have the same attitude towards web development and programming too!</p>

      <h3 id="Skydiving">Skydiving is both life changing & awesome!</h3>
      <p style="text-align: left;">I had always wanted to experience sky diving, but I was always afraid to. I had decided to overcome the fear and commit myself to a full accelerated free fall course at brakely in northamptonshire.</p>

      <p style="text-align: left;" :>After passing levels 1-8 with flying colours (giggles) and 4 consolidation jumps I had never felt more alive or proud of myself. In total I had successfully jumped 13 times out of a plane and felt amazing for it. I realised once I decide on something
        and commit to it, I always succeed and I have no doubts in myself that it shall be the same with-in the world of web development / programming too.</p>

        to become the professional I aspire and hope to be. Please do contact me if you would like to know more or discuss what your vision is as a company as I would love to be a part of it.</p>
