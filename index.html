      <h2 class="h2hello">Hello.</h2>
      <p>Yikes! my very first website! yet many more to come. I'm on a mission to become a professional web developer, not because it is easy but because it is hard,
        nothing worth doing in life is easy especially if it's something you actually want to pursue.
        Have you ever watched the pusuit of happiness? quite an inspiration of a movie, a tear jerker for some.
        I cried like a little school girl, what does that mean for me as a man? does that make me weak?</p>

        <p>ooh noo...getting emotional doesn't mean you're weak as a person. Shedding a few tears in this instance simply meant for me that I shared the main characters struggles and pain on his journey (will smith) that he had finally found something he decided to succeed at
        and I found myself wanting to find a profession and succeed on a decided path for me too.
        Life has took many twists and turns to finally decide on a career path were I felt it suited my talents, gifts, abilities, interests and natural curiosities.</p>

        <p>Steven spelberg said "I decided to become a movie director or die trying" what do you know, I have the same attitude towards web development and programming too!</p>

        <h3>Entering the world of Web development</h3>
        <p class="para4">Coding in itself forces me to think and learn in new ways i'm not used to, but I welcome and enjoy the challenge of it and wonder where it's going to take me.
          I find that coding helps me to grow personally and that to me is important as I value the idea of being able to show up for work and be myself.</p>
          <br>
          <P>I want to be able to go into work with a sense of purpose and look forward to my work life instead of drag ones self out of bed in the morning for a means of income just to pay the bills, life is too short for that.
          coding allows me to build something that doesn't exist yet too and that is just awesome.
          I come from an artistic background yet I had no idea that in code there is actually an art form to the thought process, layering, structuring, building, styling and organizing the look of what you've built when it comes to a website.
          I'm learning that web development is a digital statement for both the client and user that it should promote the purpose of a site, look fun, be engaging, clean, functional and simple to use, perhaps even educate and inspire it's users too, that's the kind of programmer I aspire to be as a web developer.</p>
          <br>
          <p>it's my aim to grow personally aswell as professionally as a programer through my work, I'm passionate about learning in itself and from others to become the best web developer I can be. The idea of working for myself or a company to satisfy a clients needs by serving their interests and fulfilling them, gives me a great sense of joy. The thought of building something with code for an
          orgainiztions or individuals requests in the form of a web application solution would be highly rewarding to me. I'd love to become a professional in this field of work because coding is really fun, challenging, interesting, I find myself curious about it and have a natural desire to improve. These attributes tell me it's what I'm meant to do for a means of an income and I don't need anyone to force me to learn either, it seems to occur all by itself. As a developer i'm learning that you're building a solution to fulfill a need and satisfying that need means i am not motiated by money,
          but instead motivated by what some call a labour of love and of learning and improving and getting paid for that as a bonus.</p>

          <p>I'm learning fast that essenstially when a client has a need, a problem arises which they seek out developers to solve their problems for them. It is my hope to be part of a fantastic team who I can grow with that learns and colaborates together and from each other to fulfill a persons or clients request to build a great web application experience with hard work and fun along the way.
          A agency that works on fun or exciting projects who helps to build an attractive solution as a service for someone elses problem that the web develoment team take joy in fulfilling. I genuinly think that you're only limited by your own imagintion and hard work.
          I truely believe I have discovered a work purpose in life and I intend to see where the world of programming and web develoment takes me and with your help I hope to be moulded into an exeptional programmer and to realise my full potential.</p>

        <h3>Skydiving is both life changing & awesome!</h3>
        <p style="text-align: left;">I had always wanted to experience sky diving, but I was always afraid to.
          I had decided to overcome the fear and commit myself to a full accelerated free fall course at brakely in northamptonshire.</p>

          <p style="text-align: left;":>After passing levels 1-8 with flying colours (giggles) and 4 consolidation jumps I had never felt more alive or proud of myself. In total I had successfully jumped 13 times out of a plane and felt amazing for it.
           I realised once I decide on something and commit to it, I always succeed and I have no doubts in myself that it shall be the same with-in the world of web development / programming too.</p>

          <p class="para5">Life is about the journey, not the destination they say. I would love nothing more than to start that journey in software engineering with an opportunity to learn and grow along side a fantastic team of staff who are willing to give me the chance to become the professional I aspire and hope to be.
